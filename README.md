# AWS_Volume_Users_Deploy


Develop an automation program that takes a YAML configuration file as input and deploys a Linux AWS EC2 instance with two volumes and two users.

Here's some guidelines to follow:

Create a YAML file based on the configuration provided below for consumption by your application
You may modify the configuration, but do not do so to the extent that you fundamentally change the exercise
Include the YAML config file in your repo
Use Python and Boto3
Do not use a configuration management framework (i.e., Ansible)
